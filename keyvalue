  i am learning yaml 
  i am going to use all of this knowledge to become expert in yaml


  # basic list method in yaml
kubernetes_objects:
  - deployment
  - replica set
  - pod
  - deamonset
  - statefulset
  - default 
file_system_heirarchy:
  - etc
  - root 
  - bin
  - sbin
  - var
  - lib
  - home
  - 

# this is for practicing the basic listing 
# keys should be lower case as a best practice
# keys should not start with numbers but can end with numbers
# keys should not have any spaces instead they need to be seperated with either _ or -
# keys should be meaningful and more clear . duplicates keys overwrites 
# key should ends with colon 

# keys can be lower case or upper case but must be lower case for boolean (true, false)
# single quotes or double quotes can be used for strings 
# - can only be used for listing 
# one single space must be there after colon 
# use 2 space indentation for list and third indentation must be hyphen and space after for value
